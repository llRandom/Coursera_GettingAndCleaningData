# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project provides an ability to prepare tidy data set based on [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) data set.
The project includes the following files:
- README.md
- run_analysis.R: script that generates the tidy data set. The original dataset should be placed in `UCI HAR Dataset` folder or you can change the `originalPath` variable in script file to set different path of data set. The output file is `tidy.txt`.
- CodeBook.md: code book that provides the description of variables, data set and transformations performed.
